/// enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type that allows you to define a set of named constant values.
/// Enumerations provide a way to represent a finite set of possible values, making your code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.
///Type safety: Enums provide type safety, meaning the values assigned to an enum are checked at compile-time
